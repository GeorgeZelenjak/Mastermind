        <p align="center">Hey there!</p>
        <p>
            This game is a variant of the original <strong>Mastermind</strong>, changed a bit to make it more fun for
            both players.
            At the start of the game, you must use colour picker in the center of your screen to <strong>create a 4-colour code</strong>
            for your opponent to guess.
            During the game, you will continue using the <strong>colour picker</strong> to make <strong>guesses</strong> as to what the
            code is that
            your opponent has in turn created for you.
            Both players take turns guessing what the code might be, all the while receiving <strong>automatic feedback</strong> showing
            how close you were.<br>
            The feedback works as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>black peg</strong> means that one of the colours from your guess is correct and in the<strong>correct
                position</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>white peg</strong> means that one of the colours from your guess is correct but in the
                <strong>incorrect position</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>The positioning of the black and white pegs in the feedback slots are <strong>no indication</strong> of
                the position on the real board.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The objective of the game is to guess the opponent's secret code <strong>before your opponent guesses yours</strong>. <br>
        The player who guesses their code first (meaning, least amount of guesses needed), wins! <br>
        </p>
        <p align="center">Good luck and have fun!</p>
