        <p align="center">Hey there!</p>
        <p>
            This game is a variant of the original Mastermind, changed a bit to make it more fun for both players.
            At the start of the game, you must use colour picker in the center of your screen to create a 4-colour code
            for your opponent to guess.
            During the game, you will the continue using the colour picker to make guesses as to what the code is that
            your opponent has in turn created for you.
            Both players take turns guessing what the code might be, all the while receiving automatic feedback showing
            how close you were.<br>
            The feedback works as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>A black peg means that one of the colours from your guess is correct and in the correct position.</li>
            <li>A white peg means that one of the colours from your guess is correct but in the incorrect position.</li>
            <li>The positioning of the black and white pegs in the feedback slots are no indication of the position on
                the real board.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The objective of the game is to guess the secret code before your opponent guesses theirs. <br>
        The player who guesses their code first (meaning, least amount of guesses needed), wins! <br>
        </p>
        <p align="center">Good luck and have fun!</p>
